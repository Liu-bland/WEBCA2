        <h1>How AI is Reshaping Healthcare</h1>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is increasingly embedded in medical practice, offering faster insights and 
            more personalized care. Below are several representative applications:
        </p>
        <section>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Diagnostics:</strong> Algorithms analyze X-rays and MRIs to highlight anomalies such as fractures or tumors earlier than traditional methods. (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/ai-transforming-global-health/">World Economic Forum</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Accelerated Drug Research:</strong> Machine learning shortens the timeline of pharmaceutical discovery by processing huge biomedical datasets. (<a href="https://www.sgu.edu/school-of-medicine/blog/ai-in-medicine-and-healthcare/">St. George's University</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Tailored Therapies:</strong> AI systems recommend treatment plans based on patient-specific genetic and clinical information. (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8285156/">NIH</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Virtual Assistants:</strong> Chatbots manage routine tasks such as scheduling, billing, and answering FAQs, freeing staff for complex care. (<a href="https://www.aidoc.com/learn/blog/3-applications-of-ai-in-healthcare/">Aidoc</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <p>
            Collectively, these innovations enhance accessibility, reduce costs, and contribute to better patient outcomes.
